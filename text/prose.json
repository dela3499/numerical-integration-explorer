["<h1>Get a feel for numerical integration!</h1><p>Play with the function on the right by dragging its parameters up or down.</p><p>The smaller plots at the bottom show the error for each of several integration methods. Specifically, they show the log of the relative error vs. the number of function evaluations. </p><p>Take the first plot, for instance. It's showing the error for the Midpoint approximation method. At the beginning, only a single function evaluation is used. As you move right on the graph, more function evaluation are used (so the subinterval width, $h$, decreases) and the error drops off.</p><p>The decline in error is common to all methods, but notice that the rate of decline seems to increase as you move from the Midpoint method to the Romberg method.  </p><p>Is this always the case? Is there some function where the Romberg method isn't the most accurate?</p><p>It turns that there is. Try moving the frequency (the number right after $sin$) to $5$. In this case, Simpson's rule seems more accurate, if only by a bit.</p><p>Feel free to play with the function parameters to gain a feel for which ones affect the integration algorithms the most. (Hint: it's frequency!)</p>"]
